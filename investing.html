<h1>Investing</h1>
  <p>When someone invests, they are distributing resources, like money, with the hope of generating a profit. Whether it's to build up the value of something and sell it later or to generate income and build wealth gradually over time. Some of the different forms of investing include the stock market, bonds, real estate, commodities, collectibles, savings accounts and funds.</p>
  <p>It is also important to understand return and risk. <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/goals-investing/why-invest/">Wells Fargo Advisors</a> say that return is the money or value you get back when you invest money into something. Risk is the possibility of receiving a lowered value from the investment.
    <p>In this section, we will introduce the different forms of investing, such as the stock market and cryptocurrency, along with providing some helpful tools and tips. Whether you want to get serious about investing or just want to get a general grasp of it, this page and the resources provided will be helpful in informing your investing decisions.</p>
