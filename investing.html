<h1>Investing</h1>
  <p>When someone invests, they are distributing resources, like money, with the hope of generating a profit. Whether it's to build up the value of something and sell it later or to generate income and build wealth gradually over time. Some of the different forms of investing include the stock market, bonds, real estate, commodities, collectibles, savings accounts and funds.</p>
  <p>It is also important to understand return and risk. <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/goals-investing/why-invest/">Wells Fargo Advisors</a> say that return is the money or value you get back when you invest money into something. Risk is the possibility of receiving a lowered value from the investment.

  <h2><u>Stock Market</u></h2>
  <p>The stock market is the place where people can trade shares, or capital, of public businesses to increase profit with low risk. Once you select and put the money into the stock of your choice, you can start enjoying the benefits. Remember to keep an eye out for how your stocks are doing to keep track of what your money is doing, updating, removing, and adding when necessary.</p>
<p>There are different types of investing in the stock market. Individual stock investments include purchasing specific business shares with your own research. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-are-etfs/">ETFs, or Exchange-traded funds,</a> are groups of individual stocks but include a broader reach of companies under the same scope, thus comprising an index and exposing. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-are-mutual-funds/">Mutual fund stocks</a> are put together by finance professionals, who manage the assets and generate the returns back to the investors. Thus, there is a group of investors who are part of the mutual fund dividing both the profits and the losses earned by stocks, bonds, and assets.</p>
  <h2><u>Cryptocurrency/NFTs</u></h2>
  <p>Cryptocurrency is a type of online currency that is exchanged across networks and spread out online, making it uncontrolled by the government. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies are <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">BitCoin</a>, which people can buy and sell with different currencies across the world to trade with each other.</p>
  <p>NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are seen as under the cryptocurrency umbrella. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp">Investopedia says</a>, “Fungibility means that the individual parts which make up a good or commodity are interchangeable.” Non-fungible things are valued separately, like jewelry. NFTs are typically composed of digital art (but can also include games and collectibles) and can be bought with cryptocurrency at a certain value, as they are made with some of the same technology. Popular NFTs include Nyan Cat, CryptoPunk, and Bored Ape Yacht Club.</p>
  <p>The NFT and crypto market boomed in 2020 and 2021, and there are several opposing opinions about them. You can read some of the advantages and disadvantages users and professionals have found in this article by GeeksForGeeks.</p>
