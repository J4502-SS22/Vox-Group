<h1>Banking</h1>

<p>Banks are a key part of cash management. It is more reliable to have money in a bank rather than under your mattress since money earns interest when it is in a bank.</p>

<h2>Terms to Know</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Checking account</strong>: bank account that is used primarily for daily transactions and typically has a low interest rate</li>
  <li><strong>Savings account</strong>: bank account that is used primarily to save money and typically has a high interest rate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Comparing bank accounts</h2>
<p>Checking and savings accounts are different at different banks, but there are some attributes of each that are at almost all banks. Checking accounts are easier to get a debit card with than savings accounts since savings accounts are not meant to be used for everyday transactions. It is also easier to write checks from checking accounts than savings accounts, and savings accounts typically limit how many withdrawals can be made in one month. Savings accounts are better than checking accounts at saving money you do not want to spend and earn more interest than checking accounts.</p>
