<h1>Budgeting</h1>
<h2>Expenses Breakdown</h2>
<p>Each month there is a certain amount of money that will be used on different
  goods and services, like phone bills and food. Some of these expenses cannot be
  avoided, while others could be considered less necessary and therefore, avoided if need be. </p>
  <p>When you know how much your after-tax salary is per year, you can find out how much
    you will have monthly to live off of by dividing the after-tax income by 12, for each of the months.
    It is suggested by most budgeting tools to divide up your monthly income into three
    categories: needs, wants, and savings/debt repayment.</p>
    <p>The 50-30-20 method is widely considered the best way to budget your monthly income.
      This method accounts for 50% of the monthly income to go to needs, 30% to go to wants,
      and 20% to go to savings and debt repayments. </p>
